# parallel-computing-proj
This project is based on implementing algorithms for an environment parallel computing on MIMD Architecture distributed memory, using the MPI Library.
In particular, it is divided into 3 parts, each of which differs in difficulty.


## First task

## Second task
The problem addressed in this document is as follows:

### Parallel Computation of the Sum of N Numbers on a MIMD Parallel Computer

The task involves calculating the sum of N numbers (a0+a1+ ‚Ä¶ + an) on a parallel computer of MIMD type with p processors and distributed memory.

On a single-processor computer, the sum is computed by performing N-1 additions one at a time in a predetermined order:

```plaintext
sumTot := a0
sumTot := sumTot + a1
sumTot := sumTot + a2
.
.
.
sumTot := sumTot + aN-1
```

Utilizing a parallel algorithm, it becomes possible to decompose the problem of size N into P subproblems of size N/P and solve them simultaneously on multiple computers. The only difficulty encountered was calculating the timing of parallel and sequential execution. This challenge, however, was successfully addressed by employing the appropriate MPI routines. To address the problem, OpenMP (Open MultiProcessing) was employed‚Äîa cross-platform API designed for creating parallel applications on shared memory systems. It is supported by various programming languages such as C/C++ and Fortran. OpenMP comprises a set of compilation directives, library routines, and environment variables that define its runtime behaviour.

The parallel algorithm employed in the described scenario is derived from the sequential algorithm but involves a distribution of iterations of the outermost loop among the threads. This outer loop iterates over the rows of matrix M. Consequently, each thread will work on a block of k contiguous rows from the shared matrix M, determining k components of the resulting vector x.

## Third task
The problem addressed in this document is as follows:

### Parallel Computation of Matrix Product on a MIMD Parallel Computer

The sequential algorithm for solving this problem is as follows:

```plaintext
for i=0,n-1 do
  for j=0,n-1 do
    cij = 0
    for k=0,n-1 do
      cij = cij + aik * bkj
    endfor
  endfor
endfor
```
Thanks to a parallel algorithm, it becomes possible to decompose the problem of size N into P-independent subproblems of size N/P and solve them simultaneously on multiple computers.

One approach is to decompose the problem into square blocks, combining the decomposition into row blocks with that into column blocks.

This type of decomposition is utilized by the Fox algorithm, also known as Broadcast-Multiply-Roll, which will be detailed in the following sections.

The algorithm is founded on the concept that goes beyond mere decomposition into square blocks. It also entails a virtual arrangement of processes within a two-dimensional grid to facilitate the resolution of the given problem.

The grid created for the given problem has a dimension equal to (p, p), where p represents the number of processes. It incorporates periodicity along both dimensions to facilitate smoother communication between processes located at opposite positions.

Each process is then assigned coordinates to determine its position within the grid, establishing an intrinsic connection with the problem at hand. Specifically, processor ùëÉ_ij will be assigned the blocks ùê¥_ij and ùêµ_ij.

The desired condition is for each processor ùëÉ_ij to compute the block ùê∂_ij of the resulting matrix C. However, with the currently possessed blocks, processor ùëÉ_ij cannot calculate this particular block of C.

The proposed approach is as follows:
-  Identify the diagonal (starting from the main diagonal).
-  Conduct a horizontal broadcast of the diagonal block of A, wherein each processor transmits its A block to other processors in the same row (Broadcast).
-  Multiply the copied block with the B block already in possession of each processor (Multiply).
-  Send the current block of B to the processor immediately positioned above the current one within the grid (Rolling).
-  Perform another horizontal broadcast of the blocks above the main diagonal.
-  Multiply the new A block with the current B block.

This algorithm needs to be iterated sqrt(number of blocks) times.
